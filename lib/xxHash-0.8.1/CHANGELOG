v0.8.1
- perf : much improved performance for XXH3 streaming variants, notably on gcc and msvc
- perf : improved XXH64 speed and latency on small inputs
- perf : small XXH32 speed and latency improvement on small inputs of random size
- perf : minor stack usage improvement for XXH32 and XXH64
- api  : new experimental variants XXH3_*_withSecretandSeed()
- api  : update XXH3_generateSecret(), can no generate secret of any size (>= XXH3_SECRET_SIZE_MIN)
- cli  : xxhsum can now generate and check XXH3 checksums, using command `-H3`
- build: can build xxhash without XXH3, with new build macro XXH_NO_XXH3
- build: fix xxh_x86dispatch build with MSVC, by @apankrat
- build: XXH_INLINE_ALL can always be used safely, even after XXH_NAMESPACE or a previous XXH_INLINE_ALL
- build: improved PPC64LE vector support, by @mpe
- install: fix pkgconfig, by @ellert
- install: compatibility with Haiku, by @Begasus
- doc  : code comments made compatible with doxygen, by @easyaspi314
- misc : XXH_ACCEPT_NULL_INPUT_POINTER is no longer necessary, all functions can accept NULL input pointers, as long as size == 0
- misc : complete refactor of CI tests on Github Actions, offering much larger coverage, by @t-mat
- misc : xxhsum code base split into multiple specialized units, within directory cli/, by @easyaspi314

v0.8.0
- api : stabilize XXH3
- cli : xxhsum can parse BSD-style --check lines, by @WayneD
- cli : `xxhsum -` accepts console input, requested by @jaki
- cli : xxhsum accepts -- separator, by @jaki
- cli : fix : print correct default algo for symlinked helpers, by @martinetd
- install: improved pkgconfig script, allowing custom install locations, requested by @ellert

v0.7.4
- perf: automatic vector detection and selection at runtime (`xxh_x86dispatch.h`), initiated by @easyaspi314
- perf: added AVX512 support, by @gzm55
- api : new: secret generator `XXH_generateSecret()`, suggested by @koraa
- api : fix: XXH3_state_t is movable, identified by @koraa
- api : fix: state is correctly aligned in AVX mode (unlike `malloc()`), by @easyaspi314
- api : fix: streaming generated wrong values in some combination of random ingestion lengths, reported by @WayneD
- cli : fix unicode print on Windows, by @easyaspi314
- cli : can `-c` check file generated by sfv
- build: `make DISPATCH=1` generates `xxhsum` and `libxxhash` with runtime vector detection (x86/x64 only)
- install: cygwin installation support
- doc : Cryptol specification of XXH32 and XXH64, by @weaversa

v0.7.3
- perf: improved speed for large inputs (~+20%)
- perf: improved latency for small inputs (~10%)
- perf: s390x Vectorial code, by @easyaspi314
- cli: improved support for Unicode filenames on Windows, thanks to @easyaspi314 and @t-mat
- api: `xxhash.h` can now be included in any order, with and without `XXH_STATIC_LINKING_ONLY` and `XXH_INLINE_ALL`
- build: xxHash's implementation transferred into `xxhash.h`. No more need to have `xxhash.c` in the `/include` directory for `XXH_INLINE_ALL` to work
- install: created pkg-config file, by @bket
- install: VCpkg installation instructions, by @LilyWangL
- doc: Highly improved code documentation, by @easyaspi314
- misc: New test tool in `/tests/collisions`: brute force collision tester for 64-bit hashes

v0.7.2
- Fixed collision ratio of `XXH128` for some specific input lengths, reported by @svpv
- Improved `VSX` and `NEON` variants, by @easyaspi314
- Improved performance of scalar code path (`XXH_VECTOR=0`), by @easyaspi314
- `xxhsum`: can generate 128-bit hashes with the `-H2` option (note: for experimental purposes only! `XXH128` is not yet frozen)
- `xxhsum`: option `-q` removes status notifications

v0.7.1
- Secret first: the algorithm computation can be altered by providing a "secret", which is any blob of bytes, of size >= `XXH3_SECRET_SIZE_MIN`.
- `seed` is still available, and acts as a secret generator
- updated `ARM NEON` variant by @easyaspi314
- Streaming implementation is available
- Improve compatibility and performance with Visual Studio, with help from @aras-p
- Better integration when using `XXH_INLINE_ALL`: do not pollute host namespace, use its own macros, such as `XXH_ASSERT()`, `XXH_ALIGN`, etc.
- 128-bit variant provides helper functions for comparison of hashes.
- Better `clang` generation of `rotl` instruction, thanks to @easyaspi314
- `XXH_REROLL` build macro to reduce binary size, by @easyaspi314
- Improved `cmake` script, by @Mezozoysky
- Full benchmark program provided in `/tests/bench`
