/*
 * Zeroize application for debugger-driven testing
 *
 * This is a simple test application used for debugger-driven testing to check
 * whether calls to mbedtls_platform_zeroize() are being eliminated by compiler
 * optimizations. This application is used by the GDB script at
 * tests/scripts/test_zeroize.gdb under the assumption that the code does not
 * change often (as opposed to the library code) because the script sets a
 * breakpoint at the last return statement in the main() function of this
 * program. The debugger facilities are then used to manually inspect the
 * memory and verify that the call to mbedtls_platform_zeroize() was not
 * eliminated.
