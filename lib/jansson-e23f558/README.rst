Compilation and Installation
----------------------------

If you obtained a ``jansson-X.Y.tar.*`` tarball from GitHub Releases, just use
the standard autotools commands::

   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make install

To run the test suite, invoke::

   $ make check

If the source has been checked out from a Git repository, the ``configure``
script has to be generated first. The easiest way is to use autoreconf::

   $ autoreconf -i


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available at http://jansson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

The documentation source is in the ``doc/`` subdirectory. To generate
HTML documentation, invoke::

   $ make html

Then, point your browser to ``doc/_build/html/index.html``. Sphinx_
1.0 or newer is required to generate the documentation.
