.TH ARES_REINIT 3 "26 November 2023"
.SH NAME
ares_threadsafety \- Query if c-ares was built with thread-safety
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

ares_bool_t ares_threadsafety(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBares_threadsafety(3)\fP function returns if the library was built with
thread safety enabled or not.

As of c-ares 1.23.0, this simply means that every public function which
references an \fIares_channel_t\fP object will lock the channel on entry and
release the lock on exit of the function.  This will prevent concurrent
thread access to the channel, thus ensuring no corruption can occur.  Future
versions will likely implement more threading-specific features.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fIares_threadsafety(3)\fP can return any of the following values:
.TP 14
.B ARES_TRUE
Built with thread safety.
.TP 14
.B ARES_FALSE
Built without thread safety
.TP 14

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function was first introduced in c-ares version 1.23.0.
