.SH NAME
h2load \- HTTP/2 benchmarking tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBh2load\fP [OPTIONS]... [URI]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
benchmarking tool for HTTP/2 server
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <URI>
Specify URI to access.   Multiple URIs can be specified.
URIs are used  in this order for each  client.  All URIs
are used, then  first URI is used and then  2nd URI, and
so  on.  The  scheme, host  and port  in the  subsequent
URIs, if present,  are ignored.  Those in  the first URI
are used solely.  Definition of a base URI overrides all
scheme, host or port values.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-requests=<N>
Number of  requests across all  clients.  If it  is used
with \fI\%\-\-timing\-script\-file\fP option,  this option specifies
the number of requests  each client performs rather than
the number of requests  across all clients.  This option
is ignored if timing\-based  benchmarking is enabled (see
\fI\%\-\-duration\fP option).
.sp
Default: \fB1\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-clients=<N>

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input\-file=<PATH>
Path of a file with multiple URIs are separated by EOLs.
This option will disable URIs getting from command\-line.
If \(aq\-\(aq is given as <PATH>, URIs will be read from stdin.
URIs are used  in this order for each  client.  All URIs
are used, then  first URI is used and then  2nd URI, and
so  on.  The  scheme, host  and port  in the  subsequent
URIs, if present,  are ignored.  Those in  the first URI
are used solely.  Definition of a base URI overrides all
scheme, host or port values.

.sp
Default: \fBh2c\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-data=<PATH>
Post FILE to  server.  The request method  is changed to
POST.   For  http/1.1 connection,  if  \fI\%\-d\fP  is used,  the
maximum number of in\-flight pipelined requests is set to
1.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-rate=<N>
Specifies  the  fixed  rate  at  which  connections  are
created.   The   rate  must   be  a   positive  integer,
representing the  number of  connections to be  made per
rate period.   The maximum  number of connections  to be
made  is  given  in  \fI\%\-c\fP   option.   This  rate  will  be
distributed among  threads as  evenly as  possible.  For
example,  with   \fI\%\-t\fP2  and   \fI\%\-r\fP4,  each  thread   gets  2
connections per period.  When the rate is 0, the program
will run  as it  normally does, creating  connections at
whatever variable rate it  wants.  The default value for
this option is 0.  \fI\%\-r\fP and \fI\%\-D\fP are mutually exclusive.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rate\-period=<DURATION>
Specifies the time  period between creating connections.
The period  must be a positive  number, representing the
length of the period in time.  This option is ignored if
the rate option is not used.  The default value for this
option is 1s.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-duration=<DURATION>
Specifies the main duration for the measurements in case
of timing\-based  benchmarking.  \fI\%\-D\fP  and \fI\%\-r\fP  are mutually
exclusive.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-warm\-up\-time=<DURATION>
Specifies the  time  period  before  starting the actual
measurements, in  case  of  timing\-based benchmarking.
Needs to provided along with \fI\%\-D\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-connection\-active\-timeout=<DURATION>
Specifies  the maximum  time that  h2load is  willing to
keep a  connection open,  regardless of the  activity on
said connection.  <DURATION> must be a positive integer,
specifying the amount of time  to wait.  When no timeout
value is  set (either  active or inactive),  h2load will
keep  a  connection  open indefinitely,  waiting  for  a
response.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-connection\-inactivity\-timeout=<DURATION>
Specifies the amount  of time that h2load  is willing to
wait to see activity  on a given connection.  <DURATION>
must  be a  positive integer,  specifying the  amount of
time  to wait.   When no  timeout value  is set  (either
active or inactive), h2load  will keep a connection open
indefinitely, waiting for a response.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-timing\-script\-file=<PATH>
Path of a file containing one or more lines separated by
EOLs.  Each script line is composed of two tab\-separated
fields.  The first field represents the time offset from
the start of execution, expressed as a positive value of
milliseconds  with microsecond  resolution.  The  second
field represents the URI.  This option will disable URIs
getting from  command\-line.  If \(aq\-\(aq is  given as <PATH>,
script lines will be read  from stdin.  Script lines are
used in order for each client.   If \fI\%\-n\fP is given, it must
be less  than or  equal to the  number of  script lines,
larger values are clamped to the number of script lines.
If \fI\%\-n\fP is not given,  the number of requests will default
to the  number of  script lines.   The scheme,  host and
port defined in  the first URI are  used solely.  Values
contained  in  other  URIs,  if  present,  are  ignored.
Definition of a  base URI overrides all  scheme, host or
port   values.   \fI\%\-\-timing\-script\-file\fP   and  \fI\%\-\-rps\fP   are
mutually exclusive.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-base\-uri=(<URI>|unix:<PATH>)
Specify URI from which the scheme, host and port will be
used  for  all requests.   The  base  URI overrides  all
values  defined either  at  the command  line or  inside
input files.  If argument  starts with \(dqunix:\(dq, then the
rest  of the  argument will  be treated  as UNIX  domain
socket path.   The connection is made  through that path
instead of TCP.   In this case, scheme  is inferred from
the first  URI appeared  in the  command line  or inside
input files as usual.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-alpn\-list=<LIST>
Comma delimited list of  ALPN protocol identifier sorted
in the  order of preference.  That  means most desirable
protocol comes  first.  The parameter must  be delimited
by a single comma only  and any white spaces are treated
as a part of protocol string.
.sp
Default: \fBh2,h2\-16,h2\-14,http/1.1\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-h1
Short        hand        for        \fI\%\-\-alpn\-list\fP=http/1.1
\fI\%\-\-no\-tls\-proto\fP=http/1.1,    which   effectively    force
http/1.1 for both http and https URI.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-header\-table\-size=<SIZE>
Specify decoder header table size.
.sp
Default: \fB4K\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-encoder\-header\-table\-size=<SIZE>
Specify encoder header table size.  The decoder (server)
specifies  the maximum  dynamic table  size it  accepts.
Then the negotiated dynamic table size is the minimum of
this option value and the value which server specified.
.sp
Default: \fB4K\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-log\-file=<PATH>
Write per\-request information to a file as tab\-separated
columns: start  time as  microseconds since  epoch; HTTP
status code;  microseconds until end of  response.  More
columns may be added later.  Rows are ordered by end\-of\-
response  time when  using  one worker  thread, but  may
appear slightly  out of order with  multiple threads due
to buffering.  Status code is \-1 for failed streams.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-qlog\-file\-base=<PATH>
Enable qlog output and specify base file name for qlogs.
Qlog is emitted  for each connection.  For  a given base
name   \(dqbase\(dq,    each   output   file    name   becomes
\(dqbase.M.N.sqlog\(dq where M is worker ID and N is client ID
(e.g. \(dqbase.0.3.sqlog\(dq).  Only effective in QUIC runs.

The <SIZE> argument is an integer and an optional unit (e.g., 10K is
10 * 1024).  Units are K, M and G (powers of 1024).
.sp
The <DURATION> argument is an integer and an optional unit (e.g., 1s
is 1 second and 500ms is 500 milliseconds).  Units are h, m, s or ms
(hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds, respectively).  If a unit
is omitted, a second is used as unit.

.TP
.B failed
The number of requests failed, including HTTP level failures
(non\-successful HTTP status code).
.TP
.B errored
The number of requests failed, except for HTTP level failures.
This is the subset of the number reported in \fBfailed\fP and most
likely the network level failures or stream was reset by
RST_STREAM.
.TP

.TP
.B traffic
.INDENT 7.0

.TP
.B headers
The  number  of response  header  bytes  from the  server  without
decompression.  The  \fBspace savings\fP shows efficiency  of header

.SH FLOW CONTROL
.sp
h2load sets large flow control window by default, and effectively
disables flow control to avoid under utilization of server
performance.  To set smaller flow control window, use \fI\%\-w\fP and
\fI\%\-W\fP options.  For example, use \fB\-w16 \-W16\fP to set default
window size described in HTTP/2 protocol specification.
