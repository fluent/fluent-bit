## Examples

There is a [simple example](./samples/hello_procedural.py) to show how to use bindings. Actually, the python binding follows C-APIs. There it should be easy if be familiar with _programming with wasm-c-api_.

Unit test cases under _./tests_ could be another but more complete references.
