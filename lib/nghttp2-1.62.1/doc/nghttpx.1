.SH NAME
nghttpx \- HTTP/2 proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnghttpx\fP [OPTIONS]... [<PRIVATE_KEY> <CERT>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A reverse proxy for HTTP/3, HTTP/2, and HTTP/1.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <PRIVATE_KEY>
Set  path  to  server\(aqs private  key.   Required  unless
\(dqno\-tls\(dq parameter is used in \fI\%\-\-frontend\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <CERT>
Set  path  to  server\(aqs  certificate.   Required  unless
\(dqno\-tls\(dq  parameter is  used in  \fI\%\-\-frontend\fP option.   To
make OCSP stapling work, this must be an absolute path.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The options are categorized into several groups.
.SS Connections
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-backend=(<HOST>,<PORT>|unix:<PATH>)[;[<PATTERN>[:...]][[;<PARAM>]...]
Set  backend  host  and   port.   The  multiple  backend
addresses are  accepted by repeating this  option.  UNIX
domain socket  can be  specified by prefixing  path name
with \(dqunix:\(dq (e.g., unix:/var/run/backend.sock).
.sp
Optionally, if <PATTERN>s are given, the backend address
is  only  used  if  request matches  the  pattern.   The
pattern  matching is  closely  designed  to ServeMux  in
net/http package of  Go programming language.  <PATTERN>
consists of  path, host +  path or just host.   The path
must start  with \(dq\fI/\fP\(dq.  If  it ends with \(dq\fI/\fP\(dq,  it matches
all  request path  in  its subtree.   To  deal with  the
request  to the  directory without  trailing slash,  the
path which ends  with \(dq\fI/\fP\(dq also matches  the request path
which  only  lacks  trailing  \(aq\fI/\fP\(aq  (e.g.,  path  \(dq\fI/foo/\fP\(dq
matches request path  \(dq\fI/foo\fP\(dq).  If it does  not end with
\(dq\fI/\fP\(dq, it  performs exact match against  the request path.
If  host  is given,  it  performs  a match  against  the
request host.   For a  request received on  the frontend
listener with  \(dqsni\-fwd\(dq parameter enabled, SNI  host is
used instead of a request host.  If host alone is given,
\(dq\fI/\fP\(dq is  appended to it,  so that it matches  all request
paths  under the  host  (e.g., specifying  \(dqnghttp2.org\(dq
equals  to \(dqnghttp2.org/\(dq).   CONNECT method  is treated
specially.  It  does not have  path, and we  don\(aqt allow
empty path.  To workaround  this, we assume that CONNECT
method has \(dq\fI/\fP\(dq as path.
.sp
Patterns with  host take  precedence over  patterns with
just path.   Then, longer patterns take  precedence over
shorter ones.
.sp
Host  can  include \(dq*\(dq  in  the  left most  position  to
indicate  wildcard match  (only suffix  match is  done).
The \(dq*\(dq must match at least one character.  For example,
host    pattern    \(dq*.nghttp2.org\(dq    matches    against
\(dqwww.nghttp2.org\(dq  and  \(dqgit.ngttp2.org\(dq, but  does  not
match  against  \(dqnghttp2.org\(dq.   The exact  hosts  match
takes precedence over the wildcard hosts match.
.sp
If path  part ends with  \(dq*\(dq, it is treated  as wildcard
path.  The  wildcard path  behaves differently  from the
normal path.  For normal path,  match is made around the
boundary of path component  separator,\(dq\fI/\fP\(dq.  On the other
hand, the wildcard  path does not take  into account the
path component  separator.  All paths which  include the
wildcard  path  without  last  \(dq*\(dq as  prefix,  and  are
strictly longer than wildcard  path without last \(dq*\(dq are
matched.  \(dq*\(dq  must match  at least one  character.  For
example,  the   pattern  \(dq\fI/foo*\fP\(dq  matches   \(dq\fI/foo/\fP\(dq  and
\(dq\fI/foobar\fP\(dq.  But it does not match \(dq\fI/foo\fP\(dq, or \(dq\fI/fo\fP\(dq.
.sp
If <PATTERN> is omitted or  empty string, \(dq\fI/\fP\(dq is used as
pattern,  which  matches  all request  paths  (catch\-all
pattern).  The catch\-all backend must be given.
.sp
When doing  a match, nghttpx made  some normalization to
pattern, request host and path.  For host part, they are
converted to lower case.  For path part, percent\-encoded
unreserved characters  defined in RFC 3986  are decoded,
and any  dot\-segments (\(dq..\(dq  and \(dq.\(dq)   are resolved and
removed.
.sp
For   example,   \fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org/httpbin/\(aq
matches the  request host \(dqnghttp2.org\(dq and  the request
path \(dq\fI/httpbin/get\fP\(dq, but does not match the request host
\(dqnghttp2.org\(dq and the request path \(dq\fI/index.html\fP\(dq.
.sp
The  multiple <PATTERN>s  can  be specified,  delimiting
them            by           \(dq:\(dq.             Specifying
\fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org:www.nghttp2.org\(aq  has  the
same  effect  to specify  \fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;nghttp2.org\(aq
and \fI\%\-b\fP\(aq127.0.0.1,8080;www.nghttp2.org\(aq.
.sp
The backend addresses sharing same <PATTERN> are grouped
together forming  load balancing  group.
.sp
Several parameters <PARAM> are accepted after <PATTERN>.
The  parameters are  delimited  by  \(dq;\(dq.  The  available
parameters       are:      \(dqproto=<PROTO>\(dq,       \(dqtls\(dq,
\(dqsni=<SNI_HOST>\(dq,         \(dqfall=<N>\(dq,        \(dqrise=<N>\(dq,
\(dqaffinity=<METHOD>\(dq,    \(dqdns\(dq,    \(dqredirect\-if\-not\-tls\(dq,
\(dqupgrade\-scheme\(dq,                        \(dqmruby=<PATH>\(dq,
\(dqread\-timeout=<DURATION>\(dq,   \(dqwrite\-timeout=<DURATION>\(dq,
\(dqgroup=<GROUP>\(dq,  \(dqgroup\-weight=<N>\(dq, \(dqweight=<N>\(dq,  and
\(dqdnf\(dq.    The  parameter   consists   of  keyword,   and
optionally followed by \(dq=\(dq  and value.  For example, the
parameter \(dqproto=h2\(dq consists of the keyword \(dqproto\(dq and
value \(dqh2\(dq.  The parameter \(dqtls\(dq consists of the keyword
\(dqtls\(dq  without value.   Each parameter  is described  as
follows.
.sp
The backend application protocol  can be specified using
optional  \(dqproto\(dq   parameter,  and   in  the   form  of
\(dqproto=<PROTO>\(dq.  <PROTO> should be one of the following
list  without  quotes:  \(dqh2\(dq, \(dqhttp/1.1\(dq.   The  default
value of <PROTO> is  \(dqhttp/1.1\(dq.  Note that usually \(dqh2\(dq
refers to HTTP/2  over TLS.  But in this  option, it may
mean HTTP/2  over cleartext TCP unless  \(dqtls\(dq keyword is
used (see below).
.sp
TLS  can   be  enabled  by  specifying   optional  \(dqtls\(dq
parameter.  TLS is not enabled by default.
.sp
With \(dqsni=<SNI_HOST>\(dq parameter, it can override the TLS
SNI  field  value  with  given  <SNI_HOST>.   This  will
default to the backend <HOST> name
.sp
The  feature  to detect  whether  backend  is online  or
offline can be enabled  using optional \(dqfall\(dq and \(dqrise\(dq
parameters.   Using  \(dqfall=<N>\(dq  parameter,  if  nghttpx
cannot connect  to a  this backend <N>  times in  a row,
this  backend  is  assumed  to be  offline,  and  it  is
excluded from load balancing.  If <N> is 0, this backend
never  be excluded  from load  balancing whatever  times
nghttpx cannot connect  to it, and this  is the default.
There is  also \(dqrise=<N>\(dq parameter.  After  backend was
excluded from load balancing group, nghttpx periodically
attempts to make a connection to the failed backend, and
if the  connection is made  successfully <N> times  in a
row, the backend is assumed to  be online, and it is now
eligible  for load  balancing target.   If <N>  is 0,  a
backend  is permanently  offline, once  it goes  in that
state, and this is the default behaviour.
.sp
The     session     affinity    is     enabled     using
\(dqaffinity=<METHOD>\(dq  parameter.   If  \(dqip\(dq is  given  in
<METHOD>, client  IP based session affinity  is enabled.
If \(dqcookie\(dq  is given in <METHOD>,  cookie based session
affinity is  enabled.  If  \(dqnone\(dq is given  in <METHOD>,
session affinity  is disabled, and this  is the default.
The session  affinity is  enabled per <PATTERN>.   If at
least  one backend  has  \(dqaffinity\(dq  parameter, and  its
<METHOD> is not \(dqnone\(dq,  session affinity is enabled for
all backend  servers sharing the same  <PATTERN>.  It is
advised  to  set  \(dqaffinity\(dq parameter  to  all  backend
explicitly if session affinity  is desired.  The session
affinity  may   break  if   one  of  the   backend  gets
unreachable,  or   backend  settings  are   reloaded  or
replaced by API.
.sp
If   \(dqaffinity=cookie\(dq    is   used,    the   additional
configuration                is                required.
\(dqaffinity\-cookie\-name=<NAME>\(dq must be  used to specify a
name     of     cookie      to     use.      Optionally,
\(dqaffinity\-cookie\-path=<PATH>\(dq can  be used to  specify a
path   which   cookie    is   applied.    The   optional
\(dqaffinity\-cookie\-secure=<SECURE>\(dq  controls  the  Secure
attribute of a cookie.  The default value is \(dqauto\(dq, and
the Secure attribute is  determined by a request scheme.
If a request scheme is \(dqhttps\(dq, then Secure attribute is
set.  Otherwise, it  is not set.  If  <SECURE> is \(dqyes\(dq,
the  Secure attribute  is  always set.   If <SECURE>  is
\(dqno\(dq,   the   Secure   attribute  is   always   omitted.
\(dqaffinity\-cookie\-stickiness=<STICKINESS>\(dq       controls
stickiness  of   this  affinity.   If   <STICKINESS>  is
\(dqloose\(dq, removing or adding a backend server might break
the affinity  and the  request might  be forwarded  to a
different backend server.   If <STICKINESS> is \(dqstrict\(dq,
removing the designated  backend server breaks affinity,
but adding  new backend server does  not cause breakage.
If  the designated  backend server  becomes unavailable,
new backend server is chosen  as if the request does not
have  an  affinity  cookie.   <STICKINESS>  defaults  to
\(dqloose\(dq.
.sp
By default, name resolution of backend host name is done
at  start  up,  or reloading  configuration.   If  \(dqdns\(dq
parameter   is  given,   name  resolution   takes  place
dynamically.  This is useful  if backend address changes
frequently.   If  \(dqdns\(dq  is given,  name  resolution  of
backend   host   name   at  start   up,   or   reloading
configuration is skipped.
.sp
If \(dqredirect\-if\-not\-tls\(dq parameter  is used, the matched
backend  requires   that  frontend  connection   is  TLS
encrypted.  If it isn\(aqt, nghttpx responds to the request
with 308  status code, and  https URI the  client should
use instead  is included in Location  header field.  The
port number in  redirect URI is 443 by  default, and can
be  changed using  \fI\%\-\-redirect\-https\-port\fP option.   If at
least one  backend has  \(dqredirect\-if\-not\-tls\(dq parameter,
this feature is enabled  for all backend servers sharing
the   same   <PATTERN>.    It    is   advised   to   set
\(dqredirect\-if\-no\-tls\(dq    parameter   to    all   backends
explicitly if this feature is desired.
.sp
If \(dqupgrade\-scheme\(dq  parameter is used along  with \(dqtls\(dq
parameter, HTTP/2 :scheme pseudo header field is changed
to \(dqhttps\(dq from \(dqhttp\(dq when forwarding a request to this
particular backend.  This is  a workaround for a backend
server  which  requires  \(dqhttps\(dq :scheme  pseudo  header
field on TLS encrypted connection.
.sp
\(dqmruby=<PATH>\(dq  parameter  specifies  a  path  to  mruby
script  file  which  is  invoked when  this  pattern  is
matched.  All backends which share the same pattern must
have the same mruby path.
.sp
\(dqread\-timeout=<DURATION>\(dq and \(dqwrite\-timeout=<DURATION>\(dq
parameters  specify the  read and  write timeout  of the
backend connection  when this  pattern is  matched.  All
backends which share the same pattern must have the same
timeouts.  If these timeouts  are entirely omitted for a
pattern,            \fI\%\-\-backend\-read\-timeout\fP           and
\fI\%\-\-backend\-write\-timeout\fP are used.
.sp
\(dqgroup=<GROUP>\(dq  parameter specifies  the name  of group
this backend address belongs to.  By default, it belongs
to  the unnamed  default group.   The name  of group  is
unique   per   pattern.   \(dqgroup\-weight=<N>\(dq   parameter
specifies the  weight of  the group.  The  higher weight
gets  more frequently  selected  by  the load  balancing
algorithm.  <N> must be  [1, 256] inclusive.  The weight
8 has 4 times more weight  than 2.  <N> must be the same
for  all addresses  which  share the  same <GROUP>.   If
\(dqgroup\-weight\(dq is  omitted in an address,  but the other
address  which  belongs  to  the  same  group  specifies
\(dqgroup\-weight\(dq,   its    weight   is   used.     If   no
\(dqgroup\-weight\(dq  is  specified  for  all  addresses,  the
weight of a group becomes 1.  \(dqgroup\(dq and \(dqgroup\-weight\(dq
are ignored if session affinity is enabled.
.sp
\(dqweight=<N>\(dq  parameter  specifies  the  weight  of  the
backend  address  inside  a  group  which  this  address
belongs  to.  The  higher  weight  gets more  frequently
selected by  the load balancing algorithm.   <N> must be
[1,  256] inclusive.   The  weight 8  has  4 times  more
weight  than weight  2.  If  this parameter  is omitted,
weight  becomes  1.   \(dqweight\(dq  is  ignored  if  session
affinity is enabled.
.sp
If \(dqdnf\(dq parameter is  specified, an incoming request is
not forwarded to a backend  and just consumed along with
the  request body  (actually a  backend server  never be
contacted).  It  is expected  that the HTTP  response is
generated by mruby  script (see \(dqmruby=<PATH>\(dq parameter
above).  \(dqdnf\(dq is an abbreviation of \(dqdo not forward\(dq.
.sp
Since \(dq;\(dq and \(dq:\(dq are  used as delimiter, <PATTERN> must
not contain  these characters.  In order  to include \(dq:\(dq
in  <PATTERN>,  one  has  to  specify  \(dq%3A\(dq  (which  is
percent\-encoded  from of  \(dq:\(dq) instead.   Since \(dq;\(dq  has
special  meaning  in shell,  the  option  value must  be
quoted.

.TP
.B \-f, \-\-frontend=(<HOST>,<PORT>|unix:<PATH>)[[;<PARAM>]...]
Set  frontend  host and  port.   If  <HOST> is  \(aq*\(aq,  it
assumes  all addresses  including  both  IPv4 and  IPv6.
UNIX domain  socket can  be specified by  prefixing path
name  with  \(dqunix:\(dq (e.g.,  unix:/var/run/nghttpx.sock).
This  option can  be used  multiple times  to listen  to
multiple addresses.
.sp
This option  can take  0 or  more parameters,  which are
described  below.   Note   that  \(dqapi\(dq  and  \(dqhealthmon\(dq
parameters are mutually exclusive.
.sp
Optionally, TLS  can be disabled by  specifying \(dqno\-tls\(dq
parameter.  TLS is enabled by default.
.sp
If \(dqsni\-fwd\(dq parameter is  used, when performing a match
to select a backend server,  SNI host name received from
the client  is used  instead of  the request  host.  See
\fI\%\-\-backend\fP option about the pattern match.
.sp
To  make this  frontend as  API endpoint,  specify \(dqapi\(dq
parameter.   This   is  disabled  by  default.    It  is
important  to  limit the  access  to  the API  frontend.
Otherwise, someone  may change  the backend  server, and
break your services,  or expose confidential information
to the outside the world.
.sp
To  make  this  frontend  as  health  monitor  endpoint,
specify  \(dqhealthmon\(dq  parameter.   This is  disabled  by
default.  Any  requests which come through  this address
are replied with 200 HTTP status, without no body.
.sp
To accept  PROXY protocol  version 1  and 2  on frontend
connection,  specify  \(dqproxyproto\(dq parameter.   This  is
disabled by default.
.sp
To  receive   HTTP/3  (QUIC)  traffic,   specify  \(dqquic\(dq
parameter.  It  makes nghttpx listen on  UDP port rather
than  TCP   port.   UNIX   domain  socket,   \(dqapi\(dq,  and
\(dqhealthmon\(dq  parameters  cannot   be  used  with  \(dqquic\(dq
parameter.

Specify  address  family  of  backend  connections.   If
\(dqauto\(dq is given, both IPv4  and IPv6 are considered.  If
\(dqIPv4\(dq is  given, only  IPv4 address is  considered.  If
\(dqIPv6\(dq is given, only IPv6 address is considered.

\X'tty: link http:/'\fI\%http:/\fP\X'tty: link'/[<USER>:<PASS>@]<PROXY>:<PORT>.    If   a   proxy
requires  authentication,  specify  <USER>  and  <PASS>.
Note that  they must be properly  percent\-encoded.  This
proxy  is used  when the  backend connection  is HTTP/2.
First,  make  a CONNECT  request  to  the proxy  and  it
connects  to the  backend  on behalf  of nghttpx.   This
forms  tunnel.   After  that, nghttpx  performs  SSL/TLS
handshake with  the downstream through the  tunnel.  The
timeouts when connecting and  making CONNECT request can
be     specified    by     \fI\%\-\-backend\-read\-timeout\fP    and
\fI\%\-\-backend\-write\-timeout\fP options.

nghttpx gracefully.   If opening  or reading  given file
fails, all loaded keying  materials are discarded and it
is treated as if none of  this option is given.  If this

Fork and execute nghttpx.  It will execute the binary in the same

of nghttpx version 1.20.0, the new main process sends SIGQUIT to the
original main process when it is ready to serve requests.  For the
earlier versions of nghttpx, user has to send SIGQUIT to the
original main process.
.sp
The difference between SIGUSR2 (+ SIGQUIT) and SIGHUP is that former
is usually used to execute new binary, and the main process is newly
spawned.  On the other hand, the latter just reloads configuration
file, and the same main process continues to exist.

nghttpx consists of multiple processes: one process for processing
these signals, and another one for processing requests.  The former
spawns the latter.  The former is called main process, and the
latter is called worker process.  If neverbleed is enabled, the
worker process spawns neverbleed daemon process which does RSA key
processing.  The above signal must be sent to the main process.  If
the other processes received one of them, it is ignored.  This
behaviour of these processes may change in the future release.  In
other words, in the future release, the processes other than main
process may terminate upon the reception of these signals.
Therefore these signals should not be sent to the processes other
than main process.

.SH SERVER PUSH
.sp
nghttpx supports HTTP/2 server push in default mode with Link header
field.  nghttpx looks for Link header field (\X'tty: link http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988'\fI\%RFC 5988\fP\X'tty: link') in response headers from
backend server and extracts URI\-reference with parameter
\fBrel=preload\fP (see \X'tty: link http://w3c.github.io/preload/#interoperability-with-http-link-header'\fI\%preload\fP\X'tty: link')
and pushes those URIs to the frontend client. Here is a sample Link
header field to initiate server push:
.INDENT 0.0

Link: </fonts/font.woff>; rel=preload
Link: </css/theme.css>; rel=preload

.UNINDENT

Currently, the following restriction is applied for server push:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
The associated stream must have method \(dqGET\(dq or \(dqPOST\(dq.  The
associated stream\(aqs status code must be 200.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This limitation may be loosened in the future release.
.sp
nghttpx also supports server push if both frontend and backend are
HTTP/2 in default mode.  In this case, in addition to server push via
Link header field, server push from backend is forwarded to frontend
HTTP/2 session.
.sp
HTTP/2 server push will be disabled if \fI\%\-\-http2\-proxy\fP is
used.
.SH UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET
.sp
nghttpx supports UNIX domain socket with a filename for both frontend
and backend connections.
.sp
Please note that current nghttpx implementation does not delete a
socket with a filename.  And on start up, if nghttpx detects that the
specified socket already exists in the file system, nghttpx first
deletes it.  However, if SIGUSR2 is used to execute new binary and
both old and new configurations use same filename, new binary does not
delete the socket and continues to use it.
.SH OCSP STAPLING
.sp
OCSP query is done using external Python script
\fBfetch\-ocsp\-response\fP, which has been originally developed in Perl
as part of h2o project (\X'tty: link https://github.com/h2o/h2o'\fI\%https://github.com/h2o/h2o\fP\X'tty: link'), and was
translated into Python.
.sp
The script file is usually installed under
\fB$(prefix)/share/nghttp2/\fP directory.  The actual path to script can
be customized using \fI\%\-\-fetch\-ocsp\-response\-file\fP option.
.sp
If OCSP query is failed, previous OCSP response, if any, is continued
to be used.
.sp
\fI\%\-\-fetch\-ocsp\-response\-file\fP option provides wide range of
possibility to manage OCSP response.  It can take an arbitrary script
or executable.  The requirement is that it supports the command\-line
interface of \fBfetch\-ocsp\-response\fP script, and it must return a
valid DER encoded OCSP response on success.  It must return exit code
0 on success, and 75 for temporary error, and the other error code for
generic failure.  For large cluster of servers, it is not efficient
for each server to perform OCSP query using \fBfetch\-ocsp\-response\fP\&.
Instead, you can retrieve OCSP response in some way, and store it in a
disk or a shared database.  Then specify a program in
\fI\%\-\-fetch\-ocsp\-response\-file\fP to fetch it from those stores.
This could provide a way to share the OCSP response between fleet of
servers, and also any OCSP query strategy can be applied which may be
beyond the ability of nghttpx itself or \fBfetch\-ocsp\-response\fP
script.
.SH TLS SESSION RESUMPTION
.sp
nghttpx supports TLS session resumption through both session ID and
session ticket.
.SS SESSION ID RESUMPTION
.sp
By default, session ID is shared by all worker threads.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-tls\-session\-cache\-memcached\fP is given, nghttpx will
insert serialized session data to memcached with
\fBnghttpx:tls\-session\-cache:\fP + lowercase hex string of session ID
as a memcached entry key, with expiry time 12 hours.  Session timeout
is set to 12 hours.
.sp
By default, connections to memcached server are not encrypted.  To
enable encryption, use \fBtls\fP keyword in
\fI\%\-\-tls\-session\-cache\-memcached\fP option.
.SS TLS SESSION TICKET RESUMPTION
.sp
By default, session ticket is shared by all worker threads.  The
automatic key rotation is also enabled by default.  Every an hour, new
encryption key is generated, and previous encryption key becomes
decryption only key.  We set session timeout to 12 hours, and thus we
keep at most 12 keys.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-memcached\fP is given, encryption keys are
retrieved from memcached.  nghttpx just reads keys from memcached; one
has to deploy key generator program to update keys frequently (e.g.,
every 1 hour).  The example key generator tlsticketupdate.go is
available under contrib directory in nghttp2 archive.  The memcached
entry key is \fBnghttpx:tls\-ticket\-key\fP\&.  The data format stored in
memcached is the binary format described below:

.UNINDENT
.sp
All numbers in the above figure is bytes.  All integer fields are
network byte order.
.sp
First 4 bytes integer VERSION field, which must be 1.  The 2 bytes
integer LEN field gives the length of following KEY field, which
contains key.  If \fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-cipher\fP=aes\-128\-cbc is
used, LEN must be 48.  If
\fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-cipher\fP=aes\-256\-cbc is used, LEN must be
80.  LEN and KEY pair can be repeated multiple times to store multiple
keys.  The key appeared first is used as encryption key.  All the
remaining keys are used as decryption only.
.sp
By default, connections to memcached server are not encrypted.  To
enable encryption, use \fBtls\fP keyword in
\fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-memcached\fP option.
.sp
If \fI\%\-\-tls\-ticket\-key\-file\fP is given, encryption key is read
from the given file.  In this case, nghttpx does not rotate key
automatically.  To rotate key, one has to restart nghttpx (see
SIGNALS).
.SH CERTIFICATE TRANSPARENCY
.sp
nghttpx supports TLS \fBsigned_certificate_timestamp\fP extension (\X'tty: link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962'\fI\%RFC
6962\fP\X'tty: link').  The relevant options
are \fI\%\-\-tls\-sct\-dir\fP and \fBsct\-dir\fP parameter in
\fI\%\-\-subcert\fP\&.  They takes a directory, and nghttpx reads all
files whose extension is \fB\&.sct\fP under the directory.  The \fB*.sct\fP
files are encoded as \fBSignedCertificateTimestamp\fP struct described
in \X'tty: link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962#section-3.2'\fI\%section 3.2 of RFC 69662\fP\X'tty: link'\&.  This format is
the same one used by \X'tty: link https://github.com/grahamedgecombe/nginx-ct'\fI\%nginx\-ct\fP\X'tty: link' and \X'tty: link https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_ssl_ct.html'\fI\%mod_ssl_ct\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
\X'tty: link https://github.com/grahamedgecombe/ct-submit'\fI\%ct\-submit\fP\X'tty: link' can be
used to submit certificates to log servers, and obtain the
\fBSignedCertificateTimestamp\fP struct which can be used with nghttpx.

Almost all string value returned from method, or attribute is a
fresh new mruby string, which involves memory allocation, and
copies.  Therefore, it is strongly recommended to store a return
value in a local variable, and use it, instead of calling method or
accessing attribute repeatedly.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
nghttpx allows users to extend its capability using mruby scripts.
nghttpx has 2 hook points to execute mruby script: request phase and
response phase.  The request phase hook is invoked after all request
header fields are received from client.  The response phase hook is
invoked after all response header fields are received from backend
server.  These hooks allows users to modify header fields, or common
HTTP variables, like authority or request path, and even return custom
response without forwarding request to backend servers.
.sp
There are 2 levels of mruby script invocations: global and
per\-pattern.  The global mruby script is set by \fI\%\-\-mruby\-file\fP
option and is called for all requests.  The per\-pattern mruby script
is set by \(dqmruby\(dq parameter in \fI\%\-b\fP option.  It is invoked for
a request which matches the particular pattern.  The order of hook
invocation is: global request phase hook, per\-pattern request phase
hook, per\-pattern response phase hook, and finally global response
phase hook.  If a hook returns a response, any later hooks are not
invoked.  The global request hook is invoked before the pattern
matching is made and changing request path may affect the pattern
matching.
.sp
Please note that request and response hooks of per\-pattern mruby
script for a single request might not come from the same script.  This
might happen after a request hook is executed, backend failed for some
reason, and at the same time, backend configuration is replaced by API
request, and then the request uses new configuration on retry.  The
response hook from new configuration, if it is specified, will be
invoked.
.sp
The all mruby script will be evaluated once per thread on startup, and
it must instantiate object and evaluate it as the return value (e.g.,
\fBApp.new\fP).  This object is called app object.  If app object
defines \fBon_req\fP method, it is called with \fI\%Nghttpx::Env\fP
object on request hook.  Similarly, if app object defines \fBon_resp\fP
method, it is called with \fI\%Nghttpx::Env\fP object on response
hook.  For each method invocation, user can can access
\fI\%Nghttpx::Request\fP and \fI\%Nghttpx::Response\fP objects
via \fI\%Nghttpx::Env#req\fP and \fI\%Nghttpx::Env#resp\fP
respectively.

current request.  Currently, method is always GET.  nghttpx
will issue request to backend servers to fulfill this request.
The request and response phase hooks will be called for pushed
resource as well.

.B attribute [R] headers
Return Ruby hash containing copy of response header fields.
Changing values in returned hash does not change response
header fields actually used in response processing.  Use
\fI\%Nghttpx::Response#add_header\fP or

header fields.

string or array of string.  It does not replace any existing
values associated with key.

.TP
.B return(body)
Return custom response \fIbody\fP to a client.  When this method
is called in request phase hook, the request is not forwarded
to the backend, and response phase hook for this request will
not be invoked.  When this method is called in response phase
hook, response from backend server is canceled and discarded.
The status code and response header fields should be set
before using this method.  To set status code, use
\fI\%Nghttpx::Response#status\fP\&.  If status code is not
set, 200 is used.  To set response header fields,
\fI\%Nghttpx::Response#add_header\fP and
\fI\%Nghttpx::Response#set_header\fP\&.  When this method is
invoked in response phase hook, the response headers are
filled with the ones received from backend server.  To send
completely custom header fields, first call
\fI\%Nghttpx::Response#clear_headers\fP to erase all
existing header fields, and then add required header fields.
It is an error to call this method twice for a given request.

.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B send_info(status, headers)
Send non\-final (informational) response to a client.  \fIstatus\fP
must be in the range [100, 199], inclusive.  \fIheaders\fP is a
hash containing response header fields.  Its key must be a
string, and the associated value must be either string or
array of strings.  Since this is not a final response, even if
this method is invoked, request is still forwarded to a
backend unless \fI\%Nghttpx::Response#return\fP is called.
This method can be called multiple times.  It cannot be called
after \fI\%Nghttpx::Response#return\fP is called.

.SH API ENDPOINTS
.sp
nghttpx exposes API endpoints to manipulate it via HTTP based API.  By
default, API endpoint is disabled.  To enable it, add a dedicated
frontend for API using \fI\%\-\-frontend\fP option with \(dqapi\(dq
parameter.  All requests which come from this frontend address, will
be treated as API request.
.sp
The response is normally JSON dictionary, and at least includes the
following keys:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B status
The status of the request processing.  The following values are
defined:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B Success
The request was successful.
.TP
.B Failure
The request was failed.  No change has been made.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B code
HTTP status code
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additionally, depending on the API endpoint, \fBdata\fP key may be
present, and its value contains the API endpoint specific data.
.sp
We wrote \(dqnormally\(dq, since nghttpx may return ordinal HTML response in
some cases where the error has occurred before reaching API endpoint
(e.g., header field is too large).
.sp
The following section describes available API endpoints.
.SS POST /api/v1beta1/backendconfig
.sp
This API replaces the current backend server settings with the
requested ones.  The request method should be POST, but PUT is also
acceptable.  The request body must be nghttpx configuration file
format.  For configuration file format, see \fI\%FILES\fP section.  The
line separator inside the request body must be single LF (0x0A).
Currently, only \fI\%backend\fP option is parsed, the
others are simply ignored.  The semantics of this API is replace the
current backend with the backend options in request body.  Describe
the desired set of backend severs, and nghttpx makes it happen.  If
there is no \fI\%backend\fP option is found in request
body, the current set of backend is replaced with the \fI\%backend\fP option\(aqs default value, which is \fB127.0.0.1,80\fP\&.
.sp
The replacement is done instantly without breaking existing
connections or requests.  It also avoids any process creation as is
the case with hot swapping with signals.
.sp
The one limitation is that only numeric IP address is allowed in
\fI\%backend\fP in request body unless \(dqdns\(dq parameter
is used while non numeric hostname is allowed in command\-line or
configuration file is read using \fI\%\-\-conf\fP\&.
.SS GET /api/v1beta1/configrevision
.sp
This API returns configuration revision of the current nghttpx.  The
configuration revision is opaque string, and it changes after each
reloading by SIGHUP.  With this API, an external application knows
that whether nghttpx has finished reloading its configuration by
comparing the configuration revisions between before and after
reloading.  It is recommended to disable persistent (keep\-alive)
connection for this purpose in order to avoid to send a request using
the reused connection which may bound to an old process.
.sp
This API returns response including \fBdata\fP key.  Its value is JSON
object, and it contains at least the following key:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B configRevision
The configuration revision of the current nghttpx
