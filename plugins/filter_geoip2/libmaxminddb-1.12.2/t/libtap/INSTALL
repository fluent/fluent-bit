To install libtap on a Unix-like system:

    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

To compile with gcc -ansi, run:

    $ ANSI=1 make

To install to a different directory than /usr/local, supply the
PREFIX variable to make:

    $ PREFIX=/usr make install

On Windows, the library can be created by first setting up the
correct development environment variables. Usually this is done by
running vcvars32.bat included in the Visual Studio distribution.
You should also install gnu make which can be found at
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm. Once this is
done, you should be able to run the following:

    > make -f Makefile.win

If you want to use it directly in another project, you can copy tap.c
and tap.h there and it shouldn't have a problem compiling.

    $ ls
    tap.c tap.h test.c
    $ cat test.c
    #include "tap.h"
    int main () {
        plan(1);
        ok(50 + 5, "foo %s", "bar");
        done_testing();
    }
    $ gcc test.c tap.c
    $ a.out
    1..1
    ok 1 - foo bar
