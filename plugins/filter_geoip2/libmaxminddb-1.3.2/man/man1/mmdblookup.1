mmdblookup \- a utility to look up an IP address in a MaxMind DB file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
mmdblookup \-\-file [FILE PATH] \-\-ip [IP ADDRESS] [DATA PATH]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]mmdblookup\f[] looks up an IP address in the specified MaxMind DB
file.
The record for the IP address is displayed in a JSON\-like structure
with type annotations.
.PP
If an IP\[aq]s data entry resolves to a map or array, you can provide a
lookup path to only show part of that data.
.PP
For example, given a JSON structure like this:
.IP "" 4
.nf
\f[C]
{
\ \ \ \ "names":\ {
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "en":\ "Germany",
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "de":\ "Deutschland"
\ \ \ \ },
\ \ \ \ "cities":\ [\ "Berlin",\ "Frankfurt"\ ]
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
You could look up just the English name by calling mmdblookup with a
lookup path of:
.IP "" 4
.nf
\f[C]
mmdblookup\ \-\-file\ ...\ \-\-ip\ ...\ names\ en
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Or you could look up the second city in the list with:
.IP "" 4
.nf
\f[C]
mmdblookup\ \-\-file\ ...\ \-\-ip\ ...\ cities\ 1
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Array numbering begins with zero (0).
.PP
If you do not provide a path to lookup, all of the information for a
given IP will be shown.
