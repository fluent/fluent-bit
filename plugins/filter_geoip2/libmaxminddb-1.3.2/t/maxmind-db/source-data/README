All of these but the City and Enterprise files are JSON dumps of the databases
created by the GeoIP2 build integration tests
(TestFor::MM::Integration::GeoIP2::Build).

Additional data was added to match our legacy test databases.

The City file is of unknown origin.

The Enterprise file is a single example IP address, modified slightly to
include all fields.

The Precision files is the normal GeoIP2 files with an additional marker
(128.101.101.101) to differentiate the two.
