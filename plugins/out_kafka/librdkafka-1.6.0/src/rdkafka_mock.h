/**
 * @name Mock cluster
 *
 * Provides a mock Kafka cluster with a configurable number of brokers
 * that support a reasonable subset of Kafka protocol operations,
 * error injection, etc.
 *
 * There are two ways to use the mock clusters, the most simple approach
 * is to configure `test.mock.num.brokers` (to e.g. 3) on the rd_kafka_t
 * in an existing application, which will replace the configured
 * `bootstrap.servers` with the mock cluster brokers.
 * This approach is convenient to easily test existing applications.
 *
 * The second approach is to explicitly create a mock cluster on an
 * rd_kafka_t instance by using rd_kafka_mock_cluster_new().
 *
 * Mock clusters provide localhost listeners that can be used as the bootstrap
 * servers by multiple rd_kafka_t instances.
 *
 * Currently supported functionality:
 *  - Producer
 *  - Idempotent Producer
 *  - Transactional Producer
 *  - Low-level consumer with offset commits (no consumer groups)
 *  - Topic Metadata and auto creation
 *
 * @remark High-level consumers making use of the balanced consumer groups
 *         are not supported.
 *
 * @remark This is an experimental public API that is NOT covered by the
 *         librdkafka API or ABI stability guarantees.
 *
 *
 * @warning THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL API, SUBJECT TO CHANGE OR REMOVAL.
