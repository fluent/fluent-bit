# Configuration properties
## Global configuration properties

Property                                 | C/P | Range           |       Default | Importance | Description              
-----------------------------------------|-----|-----------------|--------------:|------------| --------------------------
builtin.features                         |  *  |                 | gzip, snappy, ssl, sasl, regex, lz4, sasl_gssapi, sasl_plain, sasl_scram, plugins, zstd, sasl_oauthbearer | low        | Indicates the builtin features for this build of librdkafka. An application can either query this value or attempt to set it with its list of required features to check for library support. <br>*Type: CSV flags*
client.id                                |  *  |                 |       rdkafka | low        | Client identifier. <br>*Type: string*
metadata.broker.list                     |  *  |                 |               | high       | Initial list of brokers as a CSV list of broker host or host:port. The application may also use `rd_kafka_brokers_add()` to add brokers during runtime. <br>*Type: string*
bootstrap.servers                        |  *  |                 |               | high       | Alias for `metadata.broker.list`: Initial list of brokers as a CSV list of broker host or host:port. The application may also use `rd_kafka_brokers_add()` to add brokers during runtime. <br>*Type: string*
message.max.bytes                        |  *  | 1000 .. 1000000000 |       1000000 | medium     | Maximum Kafka protocol request message size. Due to differing framing overhead between protocol versions the producer is unable to reliably enforce a strict max message limit at produce time and may exceed the maximum size by one message in protocol ProduceRequests, the broker will enforce the the topic's `max.message.bytes` limit (see Apache Kafka documentation). <br>*Type: integer*
message.copy.max.bytes                   |  *  | 0 .. 1000000000 |         65535 | low        | Maximum size for message to be copied to buffer. Messages larger than this will be passed by reference (zero-copy) at the expense of larger iovecs. <br>*Type: integer*
receive.message.max.bytes                |  *  | 1000 .. 2147483647 |     100000000 | medium     | Maximum Kafka protocol response message size. This serves as a safety precaution to avoid memory exhaustion in case of protocol hickups. This value must be at least `fetch.max.bytes`  + 512 to allow for protocol overhead; the value is adjusted automatically unless the configuration property is explicitly set. <br>*Type: integer*
max.in.flight.requests.per.connection    |  *  | 1 .. 1000000    |       1000000 | low        | Maximum number of in-flight requests per broker connection. This is a generic property applied to all broker communication, however it is primarily relevant to produce requests. In particular, note that other mechanisms limit the number of outstanding consumer fetch request per broker to one. <br>*Type: integer*
max.in.flight                            |  *  | 1 .. 1000000    |       1000000 | low        | Alias for `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection`: Maximum number of in-flight requests per broker connection. This is a generic property applied to all broker communication, however it is primarily relevant to produce requests. In particular, note that other mechanisms limit the number of outstanding consumer fetch request per broker to one. <br>*Type: integer*
metadata.request.timeout.ms              |  *  | 10 .. 900000    |         60000 | low        | Non-topic request timeout in milliseconds. This is for metadata requests, etc. <br>*Type: integer*
topic.metadata.refresh.interval.ms       |  *  | -1 .. 3600000   |        300000 | low        | Period of time in milliseconds at which topic and broker metadata is refreshed in order to proactively discover any new brokers, topics, partitions or partition leader changes. Use -1 to disable the intervalled refresh (not recommended). If there are no locally referenced topics (no topic objects created, no messages produced, no subscription or no assignment) then only the broker list will be refreshed every interval but no more often than every 10s. <br>*Type: integer*
metadata.max.age.ms                      |  *  | 1 .. 86400000   |        900000 | low        | Metadata cache max age. Defaults to topic.metadata.refresh.interval.ms * 3 <br>*Type: integer*
topic.metadata.refresh.fast.interval.ms  |  *  | 1 .. 60000      |           250 | low        | When a topic loses its leader a new metadata request will be enqueued with this initial interval, exponentially increasing until the topic metadata has been refreshed. This is used to recover quickly from transitioning leader brokers. <br>*Type: integer*
topic.metadata.refresh.fast.cnt          |  *  | 0 .. 1000       |            10 | low        | **DEPRECATED** No longer used. <br>*Type: integer*
topic.metadata.refresh.sparse            |  *  | true, false     |          true | low        | Sparse metadata requests (consumes less network bandwidth) <br>*Type: boolean*
topic.blacklist                          |  *  |                 |               | low        | Topic blacklist, a comma-separated list of regular expressions for matching topic names that should be ignored in broker metadata information as if the topics did not exist. <br>*Type: pattern list*
debug                                    |  *  | generic, broker, topic, metadata, feature, queue, msg, protocol, cgrp, security, fetch, interceptor, plugin, consumer, admin, eos, mock, all |               | medium     | A comma-separated list of debug contexts to enable. Detailed Producer debugging: broker,topic,msg. Consumer: consumer,cgrp,topic,fetch <br>*Type: CSV flags*
socket.timeout.ms                        |  *  | 10 .. 300000    |         60000 | low        | Default timeout for network requests. Producer: ProduceRequests will use the lesser value of `socket.timeout.ms` and remaining `message.timeout.ms` for the first message in the batch. Consumer: FetchRequests will use `fetch.wait.max.ms` + `socket.timeout.ms`. Admin: Admin requests will use `socket.timeout.ms` or explicitly set `rd_kafka_AdminOptions_set_operation_timeout()` value. <br>*Type: integer*
socket.blocking.max.ms                   |  *  | 1 .. 60000      |          1000 | low        | **DEPRECATED** No longer used. <br>*Type: integer*
socket.send.buffer.bytes                 |  *  | 0 .. 100000000  |             0 | low        | Broker socket send buffer size. System default is used if 0. <br>*Type: integer*

socket.max.fails                         |  *  | 0 .. 1000000    |             1 | low        | Disconnect from broker when this number of send failures (e.g., timed out requests) is reached. Disable with 0. WARNING: It is highly recommended to leave this setting at its default value of 1 to avoid the client and broker to become desynchronized in case of request timeouts. NOTE: The connection is automatically re-established. <br>*Type: integer*
broker.address.ttl                       |  *  | 0 .. 86400000   |          1000 | low        | How long to cache the broker address resolving results (milliseconds). <br>*Type: integer*

The time is increased exponentially until `reconnect.backoff.max.ms` is reached. -25% to +50% jitter is applied to each reconnect backoff. A value of 0 disables the backoff and reconnects immediately. <br>*Type: integer*

internal.termination.signal              |  *  | 0 .. 128        |             0 | low        | Signal that librdkafka will use to quickly terminate on rd_kafka_destroy(). If this signal is not set then there will be a delay before rd_kafka_wait_destroyed() returns true as internal threads are timing out their system calls. If this signal is set however the delay will be minimal. The application should mask this signal as an internal signal handler is installed. <br>*Type: integer*
api.version.request                      |  *  | true, false     |          true | high       | Request broker's supported API versions to adjust functionality to available protocol features. If set to false, or the ApiVersionRequest fails, the fallback version `broker.version.fallback` will be used. **NOTE**: Depends on broker version >=0.10.0. If the request is not supported by (an older) broker the `broker.version.fallback` fallback is used. <br>*Type: boolean*
api.version.request.timeout.ms           |  *  | 1 .. 300000     |         10000 | low        | Timeout for broker API version requests. <br>*Type: integer*

broker.version.fallback                  |  *  |                 |        0.10.0 | medium     | Older broker versions (before 0.10.0) provide no way for a client to query for supported protocol features (ApiVersionRequest, see `api.version.request`) making it impossible for the client to know what features it may use. As a workaround a user may set this property to the expected broker version and the client will automatically adjust its feature set accordingly if the ApiVersionRequest fails (or is disabled). The fallback broker version will be used for `api.version.fallback.ms`. Valid values are: 0.9.0, 0.8.2, 0.8.1, 0.8.0. Any other value >= 0.10, such as 0.10.2.1, enables ApiVersionRequests. <br>*Type: string*

When using the high-level KafkaConsumer, the global `enable.auto.commit` property must be used instead]. If true, periodically commit offset of the last message handed to the application. This committed offset will be used when the process restarts to pick up where it left off. If false, the application will have to call `rd_kafka_offset_store()` to store an offset (optional). **NOTE:** There is currently no zookeeper integration, offsets will be written to broker or local file according to offset.store.method. <br>*Type: boolean*
