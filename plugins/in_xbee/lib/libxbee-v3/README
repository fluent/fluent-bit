  Digi chose some rather unfortunate (re-)names for thier XBee modules.
  To keep backwards compatibility, some modes are not named as intuitavely as
   you might expect. Please see the information below to match your module
   to the correct libxbee mode.
		
  'xbee1'  => XBee Series 1   (802.15.4 / no meshing)

=== Licensing ===
libxbee v3 is licensed using LGPLv3 from v3.0.5 onwards. For more
information on what this means for you, please see COPYING and COPYING.LESSER.


=== Building ===
If you are building libxbee, then there are a number of options avaliable to you.
Initially you should run the following command:
	$ make configure
This will retrieve a default 'config.mk' that is suitable for your system. You
should review this file and then run the following command:
	$ make all

After the build process has completed, you should find suitable files in ./lib.
E.g: for a Unix-like OS you can expect to find .so and .a files
     for Windows you can expect to find a .dll file

It is highly recommended that you don't modify any of the build system.

If you have any issues while building libxbee, please feel free to contact me,
or alternatively, you can file an 'issue' on the project site:
  http://code.google.com/p/libxbee/issues/list


=== Installation ===
To install libxbee simply type (you will require root permissions):
  $ sudo make install

This option is not avaliable on all systems (namely Windows).


=== Usage ===
Compile your applications, including "xbee.h" in the relevant source files.
Ensure you link with libxbee (e.g: using 'gcc -lxbee')

If you are compiling the object file directly into your executable instead
of making use of the library, you must include the following link flags. These
flags are also necessary for newer versions of Ubuntu, and possibly others.
  -lpthread -lrt


=== Interfacing ===
I have provided the ability to interface with libxbee from a number of languages
other than 'C'. The source, and sample code for these interfaces  can be found
in '/interfaces'. Currently the following languages are supported or in
development:
  C++ (see /xbeep.cpp and /xbeep.h)
  Java


=== Samples ===
I have proveded sample code in the ./sample directory. Hopefully this will help
get you up and running with libxbee. If you would like samples showing a different
aspect of libxbee, then please do not hesitate to get in contact, or file an
'issue' on the project site, and I will get to it ASAP:
