# Test PRs on Windows
#
# This won't run automatically on PRs from untrusted repos, it must be approved
# manually. If PR authors want to run it themselves, they should enable running
# actions on their fork, then invoke it on their branch via their forked repo's
# Actions tab.
#

on:
  # Enable invocation via Github repo Actions tab. Having this in the repo
  # allows people with github forks to run this job on their own branches to
  # build Windows branches conveniently. See DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md.
