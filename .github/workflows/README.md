## Required secrets

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* AWS_S3_BUCKET_STAGING
* AWS_S3_BUCKET_RELEASE
* GPG_PRIVATE_KEY

These are only required for Cosign of the container images, will be skipped if not present:
* COSIGN_PUBLIC_KEY
* COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY
* COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD - if set otherwise not required

## Environments

Two environments are used:
* `staging` for all staging builds
* `release` for running the promotion of staging to release, this can have additional approvals added

If an environment is not present then it will be created but this may not have the appropriate permissions then.
## Pushing to Github Container Registry

Github actions require specific permissions to push to packages, see: https://github.community/t/403-error-on-container-registry-push-from-github-action/173071/39
For some reason this is not automatically done via permission inheritance or similar.

1. Verify you can push with a simple test, e.g. `docker pull alpine && docker tag alpine:latest ghcr.io/<repo>/fluent-bit:latest && docker push ghcr.io/<repo>/fluent-bit:latest`
2. Once this is working locally, you should then be able to set up action permissions for the repository. If you already have a package no need to push a test one.
3. Go to `https://github.com/users/USER/packages/container/fluent-bit/settings` and ensure the repository has access to `Write`.
