 * The routing mask is an array integers used to store a bitfield. Each
 * bit represents the unique id of an output plugin. For example, the 9th
 * bit in the routes_mask represents the output plugin with id = 9.
 *
 * A value of 1 in the bitfield means that output plugin is selected
 * and a value of zero means that output is deselected.
 *
 * The size of the bitmask array limits the number of output plugins
 * The router can route to. For example: with a value of 4 using
 * 64-bit integers the bitmask can represent up to 256 output plugins
