# Monkey HTTP Server - Configuration
# ==================================
# These are the main variables and their descriptions, defined in respect
# to the configuration of the different types of directives.

[SERVER]
    # Listen:
    # -------
    # The Listen directive maps the port and optionally restricts the
    # network interface from where Monkey will be listens for incoming
    # connections. Multiple Listen directives are allowed.
    #
    # The Listen directive requires a port number, preceded by an
    # optional IPv4 or IPv6 address separated by a colon (:).
    # IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in brackets ([]), e.g:
    #
    # Listen 127.0.0.1:2001
    # Listen [::1]:2001

    Listen 2001

    # Workers:
    # --------
    # Monkey launches threads to attend clients; each worker thread is capable
    # of attending more than one client request at one time. The amount of
    # clients that can be handled by each thread is calculated using the
    # number of file descriptors allowed by the system. If this variable
    # is set to 0 monkey will launch one thread per processor.

    Workers 0

    # Timeout:
    # --------
    # The largest span of time, expressed in seconds, during which you should
    # wait to receive the information or waiting time for the remote host to
    # accept an answer. (Timeout > 0)

    Timeout 15

    # PidFile:
    # --------
    # File where the server guards the process number when starting.

    PidFile /

    # UserDir:
    # --------
    # Directory name for users home (~/user).

    UserDir public_html

    # Indexfile:
    # ----------
    # Number of the initial file of aperture when calling a directory.

    Indexfile index.html index.htm index.php

    # HideVersion:
    # ------------
    # For security reasons, sometimes people want to hide the version of his
    # own webserver to clients (values on/off).

    HideVersion Off

    # Resume:
    # -------
    # Allow clients to request files by ranges (values on/off).

    Resume On

    # User:
    # -----
    # If you want the webserver to run as a process of a defined user, you can
    # define it in this variable. For the change of user to work, it's necessary
    # to execute Monkey with root privileges. If it's started by a user that
    # that doesn't have root privileges, this variable will be omitted.

    User www-data

    # -----------------
    #  ADVANCED CONFIG
    # -----------------
    # Just change the next variables if you know what are you doing.

    # KeepAlive:
    # ----------
    # Allow persistent connections. (on/off)

    KeepAlive On

    # KeepAliveTimeout
    # ----------------
    # Number of seconds to wait for the next request in a persistent
    # connection (value > 0).

    KeepAliveTimeout 5

    # MaxKeepAliveRequest:
    # --------------------
    # Maximum number of requests per connection. (value > 0)

    MaxKeepAliveRequest 1000

    # MaxRequestSize:
    # ---------------
    # When a request arrives, Monkey allocs a 'chunk' of memory space
    # to receive the incoming data. As many times the incoming data
    # size is undeterminated, Monkey increases the buffer as required. This
    # variable defines the maximum size that the buffer can grow in terms
    # of KB. Example: defining 'MaxRequestSize 32' means 32 Kilobytes.
    # The value defined must be greater than zero. Default value defined
    # is 32.

    MaxRequestSize 32

    # SymLink:
    # --------
    # Allow request to symbolic link files.

    SymLink Off

    # DefaultMimeType:
    # ----------------
    # If a static content is requested and it does not contain a known extension,
    # Monkey will send the mime type specified on this directive.

    DefaultMimeType text/plain

    # FDT:
    # ----
    # The File Descriptor Table (FDT) it's an internal mechanism to share open
    # file descriptors under specific threads and virtual host context. When
    # enabled, it helps to reduce the number of opened file descriptors for the
    # same resource and the number of required system calls to open and close
    # files.
    #
    # The overhead in memory of this feature is around ~5KB per worker.

    FDT On

    # OverCapacity:
    # -------------
    # When the server is over capacity at networking level, is required to
    # prepare a contingency plan. The OverCapacity feature allows to define
    # the behavior under this situation. Monkey defines three options:
    #
    #  Drop   : just drop any new incoming connection.
    #  Resist : try to serve all request, even some of them may delay.
    #  TooBusy: report a 503 Service Unavailable HTTP status.
    #
    # The default behavior is 'Resist'.

    OverCapacity Resist

    # FDLimit:
    # --------
    # Defines the maximum number of file descriptors that the server
    # can use, it can be translated to the maximum number of connections.
    # If the value is not set, Monkey will use the soft limit imposed to
    # the process (ulimit -n).
    #
    # If the variable is set, Monkey will try to increase or decrease
    # the limit under it restrictions. For values higher that Hard Limit
    # Monkey needs to be started by root user.
    #
    # FDLimit 4096
