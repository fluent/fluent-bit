A note about signing requests to Amazon S3:

In exception to this, you do not normalize URI paths for requests to Amazon S3. For example, if you have a bucket with an object named my-object//example//photo.user, use that path. Normalizing the path to my-object/example/photo.user will cause the request to fail. For more information, see Task 1: Create a Canonical Request in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-header-based-auth.html#canonical-request
